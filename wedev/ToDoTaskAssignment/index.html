  DOM Manipulation

Use JavaScript to add tasks to the list and remove them when completed. (To complete, it's enough to click on the item, and cross it out - hint use CSS for this)

Event Handlers

Attach event listeners to handle form submission and task completion.

Event Delegation

Use event delegation to handle clicks on task items to mark them as completed or delete them.

Fetch API

Fetch a list of initial tasks from a remote API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=5).

Modern JavaScript

Use ES2015+ features like template literals, destructuring, async/await and classes
